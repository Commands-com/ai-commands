name: AI Code Reviewer
description: Intelligent code review assistant that analyzes code quality, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and best practices. Integrates with GitHub for pull request analysis, uses filesystem for local code inspection, and maintains a knowledge base of common issues and solutions across different programming languages.
allowed_tools:
  - github          # Pull request and repository analysis
  - filesystem      # Local code file analysis
  - memory          # Track code patterns and recommendations
  - sqlite          # Store review history and metrics

## Arguments

```
/code-review 
source="<github_url|local_path>" 
[languages=<auto|javascript,typescript,python,go,rust,java,csharp,cpp,ruby>]
[focus=<security|performance|style|maintainability|complexity|documentation|all>]
[severity_threshold=<info|warning|error>]
[save_report=<yes|no>]
```
*Defaults → `languages=auto  focus=all  severity_threshold=info  save_report=yes`*

### Examples

```bash
# Review a GitHub pull request for security issues
/code-review 
source="https://github.com/user/repo/pull/123"
focus=security
languages=javascript,typescript

# Review local Python code for maintainability
/code-review 
source="./src/"
languages=python
focus=maintainability

# High severity review for production code
/code-review 
source="https://github.com/org/repo/pull/456"
severity_threshold=error
focus=security,performance
```

## Context – what the AI should do

1. **Parse Arguments** into:
   * `source` - GitHub URL or local file/directory path
   * `languages` - specific languages to focus on (auto-detect if not specified)
   * `focus` - review focus area
   * `save_report` - whether to generate detailed report

2. **Source Analysis Setup**
   * If GitHub URL: `/github__get_pull_request` or `/github__get_repository_files`
   * If local path: `/filesystem__read_multiple_files` for code files
   * For PRs: Intelligently focus on changed files while considering context
   * Detect programming languages: `/filesystem__search_files` with extensions
   * Initialize memory graph for tracking patterns

3. **Comprehensive Code Analysis** (based on focus parameter)
   * **Security Review**: SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, unsafe functions, OWASP Top 10
   * **Performance Review**: Inefficient algorithms, memory leaks, N+1 queries, bundle size
   * **Style Review**: Naming conventions, code organization, consistency, formatting
   * **Maintainability Review**: Code complexity (cyclomatic/cognitive), duplication, coupling
   * **Complexity Review**: Function length, class size, dependency depth, architectural patterns
   * **Documentation Review**: Comment quality, API docs, README completeness, inline help
   * **Best Practices**: Language/framework patterns, error handling, testing coverage

4. **Pattern Recognition**
   * Compare against known anti-patterns stored in memory
   * Cross-reference with common vulnerability databases
   * Identify recurring issues across files/commits
   * Store new patterns for future reviews

5. **Language-Specific Analysis** (merged with quality checks)
   * **JavaScript/TypeScript**: async patterns, type safety, bundle optimization, ESLint rules
   * **Python**: PEP 8/type hints, security (pickle/eval), performance (list comprehensions)
   * **Go**: Error handling, goroutine safety, memory management, go vet findings
   * **Rust**: Memory safety, error handling patterns, clippy suggestions
   * **Java**: Design patterns, Spring best practices, null safety, FindBugs/SpotBugs
   * **C#**: LINQ usage, async/await, nullable reference types, code analysis rules
   * **C++**: Memory management, RAII, modern C++ features, static analysis
   * **Ruby**: Rails conventions, metaprogramming safety, performance bottlenecks

6. **Report Generation**
   * **Save Options**: 
     - `save_report=yes`: Generate detailed markdown report file `./code-review-report-[timestamp].md`
     - `save_report=no`: Display comprehensive analysis in response only
   * **Report Structure**:
     - Summary Dashboard: Overall health score, issue counts by severity
     - Detailed Findings: Organized by severity and category
     - Code Examples: Specific issues with line references and fix suggestions
     - Best Practices: Educational notes for improvement
     - Metrics: Code quality indicators when available
   * **Severity Filtering**: Only report issues at or above the specified threshold

7. **Knowledge Base Updates**
   * Store review findings in memory: `/memory__create_entities` for issues found
   * Build relationships: File → contains → Issue → relates_to → Best_Practice
   * Update SQLite with review metrics and trends
   * Learn from successful patterns for future recommendations

8. **Error Handling & Expected Failures**
   | Error Type | Message | Exit Code | Recovery Action |
   |------------|---------|-----------|------------------|
   | Bad URL | "Invalid GitHub URL format" | 3 | Check URL syntax |
   | Auth Error | "GitHub authentication failed" | 3 | Verify token/permissions |
   | Large Repo | "Repository exceeds size limit" | 2 | Use max_files or include filters |
   | No Files | "No matching files found" | 2 | Adjust include/exclude patterns |
   | Rate Limit | "API rate limit exceeded" | 3 | Wait and retry |

9. **Security & Privacy**
   * **Data Handling**: All code analysis happens locally; no code is sent to external services
   * **Memory Retention**: Review patterns stored for 30 days, anonymized after 7 days
   * **Report Storage**: Local filesystem only, user controls distribution
   * **Credentials**: GitHub tokens used only for API access, never stored in reports
