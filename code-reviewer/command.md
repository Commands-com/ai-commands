# AI Code Reviewer
---
description: >
  Intelligent code review assistant that analyzes code quality, security vulnerabilities,
  performance issues, and best practices. Integrates with GitHub for pull request analysis,
  uses filesystem for local code inspection, and maintains a knowledge base of common
  issues and solutions across different programming languages.
allowed_tools:
  - github          # Pull request and repository analysis
  - filesystem      # Local code file analysis
  - memory          # Track code patterns and recommendations
  - sqlite          # Store review history and metrics

## Arguments

```
/code-review 
source="<github_url|local_path>" 
[languages=<auto|javascript,python,go>]
[focus=<security|performance|style|all>]
[save_report=<yes|no>]
```
*Defaults → `languages=auto  focus=all  save_report=yes`*

### Example

```
/code-review 
source="https://github.com/user/repo/pull/123"
focus=security
languages=javascript,typescript
```

## Context – what the AI should do

1. **Parse Arguments** into:
   * `source` - GitHub URL or local file/directory path
   * `languages` - specific languages to focus on (auto-detect if not specified)
   * `focus` - review focus area
   * `save_report` - whether to generate detailed report

2. **Source Analysis Setup**
   * If GitHub URL: `/github__get_pull_request` or `/github__get_repository_files`
   * If local path: `/filesystem__read_multiple_files` for code files
   * Detect programming languages: `/filesystem__search_files` with extensions
   * Initialize memory graph for tracking patterns

3. **Code Quality Analysis**
   * **Security Review**: Look for SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, unsafe functions
   * **Performance Review**: Identify inefficient algorithms, memory leaks, database queries
   * **Style Review**: Check naming conventions, code organization, documentation
   * **Best Practices**: Framework-specific patterns, error handling, testing coverage

4. **Pattern Recognition**
   * Compare against known anti-patterns stored in memory
   * Cross-reference with common vulnerability databases
   * Identify recurring issues across files/commits
   * Store new patterns for future reviews

5. **Detailed Analysis by Language**
   * **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Check for async/await patterns, type safety, bundle size
   * **Python**: PEP 8 compliance, security (pickle usage), performance patterns
   * **Go**: Error handling, goroutine safety, memory management
   * **Generic**: Code complexity, test coverage, documentation quality

6. **Report Generation**
   * **Summary Dashboard**: Overall score, critical issues count, recommendations
   * **Issue Details**: File-by-file breakdown with line numbers and suggestions
   * **Learning Opportunities**: Educational comments on why certain patterns are problematic
   * **Action Items**: Prioritized list of fixes with difficulty estimates

7. **Knowledge Base Updates**
   * Store review findings in memory: `/memory__create_entities` for issues found
   * Build relationships: File → contains → Issue → relates_to → Best_Practice
   * Update SQLite with review metrics and trends
   * Learn from successful patterns for future recommendations
