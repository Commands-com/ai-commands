# Performance Agent Builder - Fixes Applied

## Production Blockers Fixed

1. **Benchmarking command corrected** ✅
   - Replaced problematic `git checkout` approach with file-copy method
   - Now uses `app_baseline.py` and `app_optimized.py` for stable comparison
   - Added JSON export and threshold checking

2. **Language schema normalized** ✅
   - Added aliases: `js`→`javascript`, `c++`→`cpp`, etc.
   - Included C/C++ support in detection and profiling
   - Normalized all language inputs through `normalizeLanguage()`

3. **Threshold enforcement implemented** ✅
   - Added `verifyPerformance()` function with rollback capability
   - Checks improvement percentage against `min_improvement`
   - Rollback mechanism for insufficient gains

4. **Runtime timer enforced** ✅
   - Added `checkRuntime()` calls throughout execution
   - Honors `max_runtime` parameter (in minutes)
   - Throws error if exceeded

5. **Package.json scripts fixed** ✅
   - Detects actual entry point from `package.main` or defaults
   - Uses existing `start` script if available
   - Parameterized commands for real use

6. **Clinic mode standardized** ✅
   - Defaults to `clinic flame` for performance profiling
   - Supports `--doctor` flag for diagnostic mode
   - Removed hardcoded paths

7. **Baseline generation added** ✅
   - Creates `.claude/perf/baseline.json` with system info
   - Captures initial performance metrics
   - Includes timestamp and configuration

8. **Performance report generation** ✅
   - Added `generatePerformanceReport()` function
   - Creates `perf_report.md` with metrics and analysis
   - Structured markdown output

9. **Tool scope restricted** ✅
   - Changed from `tools: all` to specific list
   - Only includes necessary tools for performance work
   - Improves security and focus

10. **Better install guidance** ✅
    - Platform-specific instructions (apt/yum/brew)
    - Clear error messages for missing tools
    - Separate guidance for Linux/macOS

## Additional Improvements

- **Dry-run mode** ✅ - Test without making changes
- **perfwrap enhancement** ✅ - Shows profile info after run
- **CI integration guide** ✅ - GitHub Actions and GitLab examples
- **Uninstall instructions** ✅ - Clean removal process

## Ready for Alpha

All production blockers have been addressed. The command is now ready for alpha testing with:
- Safe benchmarking without git mutations
- Proper threshold enforcement and rollback
- Normalized language support
- Practical npm scripts
- Security-scoped subagent
